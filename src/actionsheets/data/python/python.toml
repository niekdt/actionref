[Python](https://www.python.org/about/) is an easy-to-learn high-level programming language.
It is especially suitable for beginners to programming, amateurs/hobbyists, scientists, engineers.

Pros:
- **Easy to learn**
  - High-level
  - Dynamically typed
  - Simple and readable syntax
- **Vast [ecosystem](https://pypi.org/)**
- **Large community and help sources**
- **Rapid prototyping**
- **Excellent [glue language](https://www.devx.com/terms/glue-language/)**
  - Many packages interface with C or other fast languages to achieve performant code
  - Interoperable with many other languages

Cons:
- **Very slow**: About 50 times slower than C. This is not a deal-breaker though for a glue/scripting language, and for prototyping purposes.
- **Low-quality packages**: There are almost no imposed requirements on packages and compability between packages: Expect compatibility issues, breaking functionality across package versions, unintuitive APIs, and lacking documentation.
- **Non-standardized tooling**: despite the emphasis on the _Pythonic way_, there are hilariously many cases of competing tools, packages, and standards: see dependency management, repository structure, unit testing, to name a few.
- **Dynamically typed**: great for rapid prototyping, not for large frameworks.
